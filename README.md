## System Inspector for Enterprise Linux ##

System Inspector for Enterprise Linux is designed to pull some of the most of the security-relevant files and 
information from a Linux system; current versions supported are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 and 
CentOS 6 and 7. Items such as iptables may differ between the output of the running configuration  and the 
saved configuration in /etc/sysconfig/iptables, so System Inspector pulls both in order for the user to 
evaluate such conditions.

If you would like to use System Inspector to its full potential, please download the Unix Privilege Escalation
Check zip file from the following link and save the `unix-privesc-check-1_x` folder into the root of 
the `system-inspector-el[x]` folder. Note that there will probably be a `unix-privesc-check-1_x` folder within a folder of the same name, move the second folder to the `SystemInspector` directory: https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check/tree/1_x

## Requirements ## 
1. Run as root
2. Set SELinux to Permissive
3. OpenSCAP installation (openscap-scanner and scap-security-guide)

## How to Operate ##
First the user needs to run the following to clone the repo correctly, which will clone SystemInspector, repochk, and FindRogueElfs: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mitre/SystemInspector.git`

In the root directory of system-inspector-el[x], run the `inspect.sh` shell script. The user will be prompted to run the tool in either offline or online mode. If run in offline, the user is expected to have the RPM list generated by REPOCHK in the `repochk` directory`

Once the scan is complete, everything will be dumped into a `results/` folder and then into a gzipped tarball; the `results/` folder will be deleted for ease of use. 

***DO NOT FORGET TO REMOVE THE FILES FROM THE SYSTEM WHEN FINISHED.***
